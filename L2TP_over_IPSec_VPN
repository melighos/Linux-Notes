Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a VPN tunneling protocol that allows remote clients to use the public
IP network to securely communicate with private corporate network servers. L2TP uses PPP over UDP (port
1701) to tunnel the data.
L2TP protocol is based on the client/server model. The function is divided between the L2TP Network
Server (LNS), and the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC). The LNS typically runs on a network gateway
such as a router, while the LAC can be a dial-up Network Access Server (NAS) or an endpoint device with a
bundled L2TP client such as Microsoft Windows, Apple iPhone, or Android.
The primary benefit of configuring L2TP with IPsec/IKEv1 in a remote access scenario is that remote
users can access a VPN over a public IP network without a gateway or a dedicated line, which enables
remote access from virtually anyplace with POTS.
