Nagios - open source host, service and network monitoring program. It monitors specified hosts and services, alerting you to any developing issues,
errors or improvements.
1.Active and Passive check in Nagios:
Active checks are initiated and performed by Nagios:
active checks are initiated by the Nagios process.
active checks are run on a regularly scheduled basis.
Passive checks are performed by external applications and useful for monitoring services that are:
asynchronous in nature and cannot be monitored effectively by polling their status on a regularly scheduled basis.
located behind a firewall and cannot be checked actively from the monitoring host.
2.Nagios Remote Plugin Executor(NRPE) - addon is designed to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on remote Linux/Unix machines.
The main reason for doing this is to allow Nagios to monitor "local" resources (like CPU load, memory usage, etc.) on remote machines.
Since these public resources are not usually exposed to external machines, NRPE must be installed on the remote Linux/Unix machines.
