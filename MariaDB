MariaDB - reliable, high performance and full-featured database server which aims to be an 'always Free, backward compatible, drop-in' replacement of MySQL.
For security reasons, the systemd service file contains ProtectHome=true, which prevents MariaDB from accessing files under the /home, /root and /run/user hierarchies. The datadir has to be in an accessible location and owned by the mysql user and group.
/etc/my.cnf /etc/my.cnf.d/ ~/.my.cnf (config files location)
/etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf:
#skip-networking                    (enable access your MySQL server from other LAN hosts)
bind-address = <some ip-address>
port=3360                           (you can add setting to run database on non-standard port)

commands:
mariadb-install-db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql (script to set up MariaDB, run the following command before starting the mariadb.service)
mysql --version (version of MySQL or MariaDB database)
mysql_secure_installation (command will interactively guide you through a number of recommended security measures)
mysqlcheck -A --auto-repair -f -o -u root -p (Forcefully optimize all tables, automatically fixing table errors that may come up)
mysql -u root -p (enter your MySQL as root user) # If you haven’t set a password for your MySQL root user, you can omit the -p switch
mysql_upgrade -u root -p (upgrade databases)

MySQL commands:
mysql> CREATE USER 'myuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword'; (create new user and give him password)
mysql> CREATE USER 'newuser'@'10.8.0.5' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password'; (grant created user access from another host)
mysql> CREATE USER 'newuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password'; (create a user that can connect from any host, use the '%')

mysql> CREATE DATABASE `mydb`; (create new database)
mysql> CREATE TABLE `db_name`.`tbl_name`; (create new table in specific database)

mysql> SHOW DATABASES; (list of the available databases)
mysql> SHOW TABLES; (list of the available tables)
mysql> DESC `mydb`; (structure of any particular table)

DROP USER myuser@localhost; (delete user)
DROP DATABASE mydb; (delete database)

mysql> GRANT permission1, permission2 ON 'database_name.table_name' TO 'database_user'@'localhost'; (grant specific privileges to a user account)
mysql> GRANT ALL privileges ON `mydb`.* TO 'myuser'@localhost; (grant all privileges to a user for all tables of specific database)
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'192.168.1.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_optional_remote_password' WITH GRANT OPTION; (grant remote access for your user)
mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'database_user'@'localhost'; (remove privileges)
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES (Apply changes to assigned permissions)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Commonly used privileges are:
    ALL PRIVILEGES – Grants all privileges to a user account.
    CREATE – The user account is allowed to create databases and tables.
    DROP - The user account is allowed to drop databases and tables.
    DELETE - The user account is allowed to delete rows from a specific table.
    INSERT - The user account is allowed to insert rows into a specific table.
    SELECT – The user account is allowed to read a database.
    UPDATE - The user account is allowed to update table rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'database_user'@'localhost'; (show user permissions)
mysql> SELECT User, Host FROM 'mysql.user' WHERE Host <> 'localhost'; (Check current users with remote access privileged)


Backup and Restore:
For automatic backup:
Store mysql root password in /root/.my.cnf so our script (running as root) can access it. chmod 600
[client]
user=root
password=yourmysqlrootpassword

mysqldump --add-drop-table --databases <databasename> | gzip -9 > /backup/sql/<database>-date +\%y-\%m-\%d--\%H:\%M.sql.gz

------------------------------------------------------
Or:
You should add the following section to the relevant configuration file:
[mysqldump]
user=mysqluser
password=secret

Example script:
#!/bin/bash

THISDIR=$(dirname $(readlink -f "$0"))

mysqldump --single-transaction --flush-logs --master-data=2 --all-databases \
 | gzip > $THISDIR/db_backup.gz
echo 'purge master logs before date_sub(now(), interval 7 day);' | mysql
------------------------------------------------------
mysqldump --single-transaction --flush-logs --master-data=2 --all-databases -u root -p | gzip > all_databases.sql.gz (create and compress SQL tables backup)
zcat all_databases.sql.gz | mysql -u root -p (Decompressing the backup thus created and reloading it in the server)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Holland Backup:
python-based software package to automate all of the backup work. It supports direct mysqldump, LVM snapshots to tar files (mysqllvm),
LVM snapshots with mysqldump (mysqldump-lvm), and xtrabackup methods to extract the data.
The Holland framework supports a multitude of options and is highly configurable to address almost any backup situation. 
Example configurations for each method are in the /usr/share/doc/holland/examples/ directory and can be copied to /etc/holland/backupsets/,
as well as using the holland mk-config command to generate a base config for a named provider.
